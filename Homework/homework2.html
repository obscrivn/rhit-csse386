      <h1>Homework 2: Advanced Data Mining Techniques</h1>
      
      <p>Objective:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enhance your data exploration and preprocessing techniques by incorporating advanced dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA and LDA.</li>
  <li>Strengthen your understanding of unsupervised learning by generating clustering-based pseudo-labels for further supervised analysis.</li>
  <li>Develop critical thinking skills by comparing different data representations and evaluating their impact on predictive modeling.</li>
  <li>Foster the ability to derive actionable insights and data-driven recommendations based on comprehensive analysis.</li>
</ul>


      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>This is an individual assignment. No collaboration is allowed.</p>
      <p>
        In Homework 2 you will extend your analysis from Homework 1
      </p>
      <p><strong>Provide reference/citation to any method, metric, function that had not been covered in class.</strong> For any methods/code covered in class Labs, you do not need to provide references.</p>
      
      <h3>1. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) 30pts</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Standardize/normalize your dataset if you have not already done so in Homework 1</li>
            <li>Apply PCA to your dataset</li>
            <li>Plot the explained variance ratio for the principal components (e.g., a scree plot)</li>
            <li>Choose the number of components to retain and explain your choice</li>
            <li>Visualize your data projected onto the first two principal components. Discuss any interesting observation (recall how we interpreted the PCA plots in class)</li>
          </ul>


            <h3>2. LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) 30pts</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>If your dataset contains a categorical variable, use it for LDA</li>
            <li>If you dataset does not contain any features that can be used as classes, 
                revisit your cluster analysis and create a new column with cluster labels - these will be your classes for LDA
            <pre><code>HINTS (example):
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
cluster_labels = kmeans.fit_predict(scaled_data)
# Use cluster_labels as your y:
lda.fit_transform(scaled_data, cluster_labels)
            </code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>Show the graph with the labels/classes distribution - is it balanced or unbalanced?</li>
            <li>Apply LDA. Hint: use sklearn examples for plotting LDA as scatterplot</li>
            <li>Discuss any interesting observations and the model prediction</li>
          </ul>


      

      <h3>3. Enhanced Predictive Modeling 30pts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Integrate your PCA into your predictive modeling framework from Homework 1 (you only need one regression model)
        </li>
        <li>
          Evaluate whether the reduced feature space leads to improved model performance
        </li>
        
      </ul>
      
      <h3>4. Reflections 10pts</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Did you find the dimensionality techniques helpful to improve the predicting models?
            </li>
            <li>
                Summarize the key insights obtained from applying PCA and LDA (for example, in your report to the client, what would you share as insights from this data)
            </li>
            <li>What did you learn from this homework? Share your experience and any challenges you faced.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        
      

      <h2>Submission Instructions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Submit your homework as a URL with clearly labeled sections corresponding to the tasks above (continue your homework 1 colab)</li>
        <li>Use text cells for providing written explanations</li>
        <li>Ensure your code is clean and warnings are suppressed (e.g., using <code>import warnings; warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')</code>).</li>
      </ul>
