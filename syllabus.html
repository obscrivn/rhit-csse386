<h3>CSSE386 - Introduction to Systems Programming</h3>

<p>Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</p>

<p>Computer Science and Software Engineering Department</p>

<p>Winter 2024-2025</p>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>Provides students with understanding of computer system level issues and their impact on the design and use of computer systems. Students will study low-level programming (assembly) and memory operations, representation of various types of data and programs in memory, and resource/efficiency trade-offs. System requirements such as resource management, security, communication and synchronization are studied and basic systems tools for these tasks are implemented. Course topics will be explored using a variety of hands-on assignments and projects.</p>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

<p>CSSE 120</p>

<p>Students who successfully complete this course should be able to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Describe the functions of common computer system hardware elements including CPU, memory hierarchy and input/output devices.</p></li>

<h4>Homework</h4>

<p>The homework assignments are listed on the class schedule. 
Homework is due by 11:59pm on the stated date. All assignments, written and coding, should be 
submitted to Gradescope (see link from Moodle page.) </p>

<p>Solutions will generally be available the day after homework is due. Therefore,
no late homework submissions are accepted. Solutions to the homework should be
presented using good style. Your name should appear at the top of each page. Be
sure to state any assumptions that you make to solve the problem. Above all it
must be legible--if the graders can't read it, you won't get credit.</p>

<!-- In addition to written homework, there will be small coding
assignments done on a web site specified by your instructor.  These will be
graded like small homework assignments and are intended as interactive reading
assignments to be done outside of class. -->

<h4>Quizzes</h4>

<p>Many classes will involve in-class quizzes, which are used like worksheets.
Quiz solutions will be regularly posted.
Quizzes will not generally be collected for credit---their main purpose is to support student learning.
However, completing quizzes is one element of your Class Participation grade.
<!-- Quizzes cannot be made up.
One quiz will be dropped from the final quiz score.--></p>

<h4>Class participation</h4>

<p>A small amount of the overall grade is for class participation.
Part of this is class attendance, which is required.
Some amount of this grade will be determined subjectively by the instructor:
to earn credit for this category, students should arrive on time to class in a state to learn, actively engage in class time, and generally be a good "citizen" of CSSE132.</p>

<h4>Laboratory Assignments</h4>

<p>There are several labs listed on the on the schedule. The labs utilize Linux,
C, assembly language.
Completed labs are submitted via in-person verification and GradeScope.  When done in partners,
both of you must be able to demonstrate your solutions.</p>

<h4>Exams</h4>

<p>There will be two midterm exams and a final exam. <br></p>

<h4>Grading</h4>

<p>You <strong>must</strong> earn a passing (60%) exam average (weighted by the exams' weights) to pass the course.</p>

<p>Assuming the above "exam average" conditions are met, the overall grade is computed according to the following weights.</p>

<div align="center">
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Class participation</td>        <td>5%</td> </tr>
<tr><td>Homework</td>        <td>16%</td> </tr>
<tr><td>Labs</td> <td>16%</td> </tr>
<tr><td>Exams</td>                       <td>63% = 18% + 18% + 27%</td> </tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>

<p>Generally, 90-100% is an A, 85-89% is a B+, etc.</p>

<p>The above is a guideline that we typically  follow. Please understand that it is not a promise.
We will do our best to conform to the institute-wide grading policy described in the
<a href="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/campus-life/student-services/registrar/rules-and-procedures/grades.html">Grade Descriptions</a>
section of the registrar's web page.  As you read it, note in particular that phrase "thorough competence to do excellent work" appears in the description of the "B" grade (the standard for "A" is even higher), and it further states that "B" and "B+" will not be given for mere compliance with the minimum essential standards of the course.</p>

<h4>Collaboration</h4>

<p>Collaboration is encouraged on homework and laboratories. It is prohibited on exams.</p>

<p>When you collaborate, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>properly credit your collaborators</li>
<li>clearly indicate the extent of the collaboration</li>
<li>understand the work as well as if it were your own and are able to explain it to your instructor</li>
</ul>

<p>Working out a homework solution as a group can be acceptable collaboration if you follow the guidelines above. Each <em>individual</em> is responsible for understanding the entire solution. <em>For homework, this means that once a group solution has been achieved, each collaborator must rework the problem and write up the solution independently.</em></p>

<p>If you are ever in doubt about whether some specific situation violates the policy, the best approach is to discuss it with your instructor beforehand. This is a very serious matter that we do not take lightly. Nor should you.</p>

<p>You should never look at another student's code to get ideas of how to write your own code. Beginning the process of producing your own solution with an electronic copy of work done by other students is never appropriate.</p>

<h4>Use of Internet and LLMs for Class Work</h4>

<p>Searching the Internet or other resources for answers to homework problems, labs, or exams is considered academic dishonesty.
Likewise, use of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT to obtain answers to homework problems, labs, or exams is considered academic dishonesty.</p>

<p>This policy are in place because it is not helpful to your learning to use these tools in this way, and academic integrity requires that all of the work you submit is your own.</p>

<h4>Academic Integrity and CSSE Integrity Committee Procedures </h4>

<p>It is critical to maintain academic integrity. It is essential for all students to cite any and all sources of help received in completing coursework. This practice not only fosters a culture of honesty and transparency but also prevents misunderstandings that might otherwise escalate to formal proceedings. Students should also be aware of what is appropriate help on homework assignments – see <a href="https://rosehulman.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/CS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B72D3DC4B-233D-4DF6-8E10-736359A06C80%7D&amp;file=IntegrityPilotPolicy%20-%20What%20Constitutes%20Misconduct.docx">What Constitutes Misconduct</a>. To ensure fairness and responsibility, any instances of suspected misconduct will be handled through the CSSE Integrity Committee.  </p>

<p>If a case of suspected misconduct arises, it will be submitted to the CSSE Integrity Committee for review (see
<a href="https://rosehulman.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/CS/Shared%20Documents/Pilot%20Integrity%20Policy/IntegrityPilotPolicy%20-%20Procedures.docx?d=wf4c70babf3ac434ba29d5518dca9f877&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=1efwlT">Policies and Procedures</a> and possible penalties (see <a href="https://rosehulman.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/CS/Shared%20Documents/Pilot%20Integrity%20Policy/IntegrityPilotPolicy%20-%20Penalties%20%26%20Evidence.docx?d=w916e293ca31a4493bdbdd6b78ed2d3dd&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=wCWF2K">IntegrityPilotPolicy</a>). The process includes an initial review of the evidence by the committee, a time for students to explain or admit to potential misconduct, and potentially a hearing to examine the circumstances and evidence. Students are encouraged to continue their studies and engage with the course material and instructor normally throughout the investigation. </p>

<p>This policy can also lead to activating the Institute Academic Integrity Policy, described <a href="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/offices-and-services/student-affairs/student-handbook-2015-2016/institute-policies,-rules-regulations.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<p>It is expected that any work submitted for assessment represents the intellectual work of the individual(s) submitting the work. Any attempt to pass off the intellectual work of another (including the work generated by Large Language Models like ChatGPT) as their own or without proper attribution is an example of academic misconduct and is subject to the penalties described in the Rose-Hulman Academic Rules and Procedures and Student Handbook documents.</p>
